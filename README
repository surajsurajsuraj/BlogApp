Implementation of all 7 RESTful routes.
Steps to run:
    0.)  Clone or download.
    1.)  You should start with "npm init"
    2.)  The dependencies can be seen in package.json file. You can install it using "npm install dependencies_name --save".
    3.)  Configure mongoose from the documentation, I was working on goormide which has a container that supports Ubuntu 14.x,
    4.)  So mongoose's latest version that supports Ubuntu 14.x is 4.0. You should install it for better performance. 
    5.)  You will encounter some deprecation warning from mongoose just do as written in docs for the particular warning.
    6.)  ./mongod is command to start database, you should leave it running.
    7.)  Finally type "node app.js" and see the magic.
